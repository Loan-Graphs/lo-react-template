A pre-approval letter tells sellers you're serious and financially qualified, giving you an edge in Austin's competitive market where multiple offers on desirable properties are still common heading into 2026.",

The good news: inventory has improved significantly compared to the frenzy of 2021-2022, giving buyers more options and slightly more negotiating room. Interest rates have stabilized in the mid-6% range, meaning a $400,000 loan at 6.5% puts your principal and interest payment around $2,528 per month — before taxes and insurance.",

Work with a local real estate agent who knows Austin's neighborhoods, from the established charm of Travis Heights to the rapid growth in areas like Manor and Buda. When you find the right home, your pre-approval lets you move quickly — and in a market where speed matters, that can make the difference between getting the home or losing it.",

With an FHA loan at 6.5% and 3.5% down ($14,000), you're looking at about $2,440 in P&I plus roughly $177 per month in mortgage insurance — totaling $2,617. Over 30 years, the VA loan saves approximately $55,000 in total payments, primarily from avoiding mortgage insurance.",

Luke Air Force Base is a major employer, and the Valley has a large veteran population with established VA-experienced lender networks. Phoenix-area home values have stabilized after the 2022-2023 correction, making it a good time for both VA and FHA buyers to enter the market. The 2026 FHA loan limit for Maricopa County is $498,257 for a single-family home, while VA loans have no loan limit for borrowers with full entitlement — meaning you can buy above the FHA cap without a down payment using your VA benefit.",

However, FHA loans make sense in specific situations: if you've already used your VA entitlement and haven't restored it, if you're buying a multi-unit investment property, or if you're purchasing with a non-veteran co-borrower who doesn't qualify for a VA loan. The best approach is to get pre-approved for both and compare the actual numbers for your specific situation.",

First, consider buying down your rate: paying 1 point (1% of your loan amount) upfront can reduce your rate by about 0.25%, saving you significantly over time. Second, look into Colorado Housing and Finance Authority (CHFA) programs that offer down payment assistance up to 3% of the loan amount. Third, house-hacking with an FHA loan on a duplex lets you live in one unit and rent the other — the rental income can offset most of your mortgage payment. Finally, don't overlook Denver's emerging neighborhoods where prices haven't caught up to infrastructure improvements.",

A VA loan with no down payment and no PMI changes the math significantly. So does an FHA loan with 3.5% down. The best next step is to get pre-approved by a local Denver lender who can run your actual numbers and show you exactly what you qualify for, so you can search with confidence.",
